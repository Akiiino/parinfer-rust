*parinfer.txt*	Automagic Lisp Bracket Balancing

==============================================================================
I. INTRODUCTION				    *parinfer* *parinfer-introduction*

This plugin does smart things to maintain balanced parentheses as you type in
lisp code.

It is based on a Rust port of Shaun Lebron's "parinfer" library.  This manual
covers the Vim plugin part only - you should visit the parinfer website for
information on what parinfer itself does for you.

II. OPTIONS				       		    *parinfer-options*

							     *g:parinfer_mode*
The mode used to process buffer changes: 'smart', 'indent', or 'paren'.
>
        " Default
        let g:parinfer_mode = 'smart'
<
						    *g:parinfer_force_balance*
In smart mode and indent mode, parinfer will sometimes leave unbalanced
brackets around the cursor and fix them when the cursor moves away.  When this
option is set to 1 or |v:true|, the brackets will be fixed immediately (and
fixed again when text is inserted).
>
        " Default
	let g:parinfer_force_balance = 0
<
						       *g:parinfer_dylib_path*
This is the path to the dynamically loaded library which contains the Rust
port of parinfer.  This should be detected automatically for most normal
installation methods.  If it doesn't, please report a bug.
